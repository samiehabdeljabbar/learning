# All Language elemts are in this code
#Finding all the Objects in the code?

a = 4
b = 5
c = [6, 7, 8]

d = "Hi"
"Hello"

def area(x):
    return x**2

print(area(3))

# Elements: Objects, Identifiers, Operators, Delimiters, Keywords, Comments, Blank Lines, White Space
# Objects in this code are: 4, 5, [6, 7, 8], 6, 7, 8, "Hello", "Hi", Function definition, 2,3,9
#Idenitifiers in this code are: a, b, c, d, area, c
# So for Example, my name would be the Identifier (samieh) and the object would be me
# Also identifiers include names of functions that you have
# The operators are **
# The delimiters are: =,"" () : []
#Key words: Def, Return
# Comments, example all the above comments
# Blank Lines
# White Space
# We also have indentation, which is part of the syntax of python
